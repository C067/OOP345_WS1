In this workshop, there was at least three concepts that I have learned; the use of static, extern, and the use of 
auto. Static, an internal linkage, allows the user to declare a variable with the same name more than once within the 
same scope or module. By using Static in this workshop, we are able to use the same variable in more than one scope and then 
 change the value of this variable whenever we want to become the same variable but with a different address. Extern, an 
external linkage, allows the user to use the same variable the user has declared in a scope to be used in another module. This
command allows use to use this variable in our workshop to set a MAX amount or even print out what the MAX amount is. The 
command auto, is a special command because it auto identifies the type it should use when a variable is declared. 

Another thing that I have learned while doing this workshop is how to incorporate arguments entered by the user. By using 
this we can take each argument store it into a variable and then display or make any changes to this argument.
